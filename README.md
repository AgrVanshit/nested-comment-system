# 🗨️ Nested Comment System

This repository implements a **Nested Comment System**, which allows users to add, reply to, and manage comments in a hierarchical format. It’s a powerful way to display threaded conversations, similar to how comments work on many modern platforms (e.g., Reddit, YouTube).

## 🚀 Features

- 🏷️ **Nested Structure:** Users can add replies to comments, allowing for deep threading.
- 🗂️ **Tree Traversal:** Efficient traversal techniques to display and manage nested comments.
- 📦 **Lightweight and Simple:** Easily integrates into any project requiring a threaded comment feature.
- 💬 **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy to use.

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgrVanshit/nested-comment-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd nested-comment-system
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:

   Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the project**:

   After the dependencies have been installed, start the project by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the app in your browser**:

   Once the project is running, it should automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🧠 How It Works

This system uses a **tree traversal technique** to manage and display nested comments. Each comment is treated as a node, and replies are children of that node. This hierarchical structure ensures that replies appear directly beneath their parent comments, maintaining context.

### 🌳 Tree Traversal Technique

We use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to traverse the comments and display them in a structured manner. Here's a quick overview of how this works:

1. **DFS** starts from the root comment and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
2. This approach ensures that for each comment, all its replies are handled before moving to the next comment at the same level.
3. The traversal visits each node (comment) recursively, ensuring that the nested replies are displayed in the correct order.

Here's a simplified version of the DFS algorithm used:

```javascript
function traverseComments(comment) {
    console.log(comment.text); // Display the current comment
    
    // Traverse through the replies (children) recursively
    comment.replies.forEach(reply => {
        traverseComments(reply);
    });
}
```

This technique is ideal for comment systems, as it ensures proper indentation and organization of replies.
